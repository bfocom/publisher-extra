# XSLT to convert CII XML to HTML, and from there to Factur-X
This folder contains a sample XSLT stylesheet and corresponding CSS
stylesheet that can be used to convert CII XML documents to HTML,
and from their (with BFO Publisher) to a Factur-X compliant PDF.

The HTML is intended for print output, but will work on screen as
well.

_This is intended as a technology demonstrator!_
We make no warranties whatsoever about the correctness of
any the visualization, although we can guarantee that the PDF will
meet the technical requirements of Factur-X
